                        <p class="text-muted">Unlike Hellgates, in Corrupted Dungeons, the enemies doesn't disappear when a PvP is about to happen. It is a dungeon, and it will act one. Complete with mobs, bosses, and all that stuff. Players can either clear a specific area in the dungeon to take the fight, without mobs interfering... or lure into an area to use the mobs to your advantage.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">PvP happens when a dungeon is "invaded" by another player. How this "invasion" happens? The corrupted has this match-up running while you clear the dungeon ang gain "infamy", which is the basis of the match-up. If you want to invade, just interact on the shrine at the beginning of the dungeon. If you want to be invaded, clear 80% of the infamy bar and activate the shrine. Once done, there is a 100% chance of PvP after 30-40 seconds. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">If you are looking for just taking advantage on the loots of the dungeon, always go for full-on mobility. If you are looking for a fight, on average, always have a build that has the 3 factors: <strong>Consistent Offense</strong>, <strong>Sustain</strong>, and <strong>Mobility</strong>.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Consistent "Offense" is not just damage. It can be either Sustained Damage, Heavy CC, or Burst Damage. Something that you are doing consistently. Practically how your build attacks.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">In CDG, there are the most common weapons that you will encounter (by the time of writing this): Black Hands, Quarterstaff, and Regular Bow.</p>

After that, use defensive skills, reset cooldown with Assassin Hood, and do combo again. If done successfully, that will surely defeat the opponent because it gives off a high amount of damage.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Albion Online is a PvP MMORPG that thrives on small-scale (&#60;20) and ZVZ (50+) fights. With that said, most of its offensive, defensive and utility skills are designed to that content. And that means there will always be a build that seems to be "unfair" in a 1v1 fight.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">There is not much to say but to get good, move on, fight and repeat. There is no stopping you from using "that" cheesy build, destroy crystals to escape, or just play another area in-game. There is much to Albion than just Corrupted Dungeons.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">However, if you're still here, I guess that "Specialized" Build talk doesn't deter your will to play Corrupteds. So without further ado...</p>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">My screen turned red and there is an evil presence. What should I do?</h3>
                </div>

                        <h4 class="my-3">Invader vs Invaded: Which is which?</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">In a PvP situation in the Corrupteds, there are 2 kinds of players: the one invading, or the one being invaded.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">By design, the invader is the one who seeks PvP, the one who's more prepared on seeking a fight against the unprepared player. However, with how match-ups work, sometimes, the invaded player sets-up the dungeon to give the invader a very "warm" welcome, the kind of welcome which teleports the invader to his last city.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">So there is no really significant difference between the two, aside from the game mechanic where the invader is the one who goes to your dungeon. It is still up to the player to decide on what position to take: is he going to be the invaded one... or the invader who seeks blood?</p>
                    
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h4 class="my-3">I saw the enemy! What should I do?</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Once your enemy is on screen, make it a habit to Inspect (Y) them first before engaging. This helps you to have an insight on how they play, they escape, and most importantly, how YOU should play in order to win.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The rule of thumb is to never rush, so that you could not be in a disadvantage when it comes to the environment and skillset you're in. So by inspecting them, you could equip the proper potion, the proper food, and skill configuration with your gears. Another note is that CDG is still a dungeon, so its mechanic and environment is a part of your battle. Better adapt to it.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">With that said, you've checked their gears, you've checked the area, and it all checks out. It's time to fight.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h4 class="my-3">The Actual Fighting</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">There is no definite guide or way to fight, unless your build has this one combo to pull off. It really depends on the current situation. What I can give you is the general things to remember during the fight.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted"><strong>Improve Reaction, Minimize Anticipation.</strong> Most of the time, you would want to get the most out of your equipment in the Corrupteds, as there will be no one to back you up during the fight.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">With that said, you should always be mindful of your enemy's actions-- whether it's closing the gap between them and you, ate a food, applied a buff, or even where they're going, because you will have to react to it accordingly.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">Why react rather than prevent their action, you would ask? It's because you don't want to waste your skills on a 1v1 fight. 10 seconds of misused cooldown can get you killed, in a fight where you should be aware of everything because you're on your own.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">Your HP is going to be decreased, that debuff will affect you one way or another... why pre-emptively pop your Hunter Hood if your enemy can wait it out until the buff is gone?</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">Unless you're sure how things would play out, do not act out of anticipation. Every second of cooldown counts.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted">Corrupted Dungeons is kinda the "try-hard" part of the game, in which some people will abuse it in order to win. I mean, who likes losing, right? With that said, please do not ever forget that it is there for you to have fun, and have a short moment to escape what real life has to offer.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">If you're losing, that's okay. Meaning you got matched-up pretty bad, or you have many room for improvement. Either way, please see it as a room for improvement. Dying is a part of the Albion Experience, make the most of it by learning things and to be better.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">This guide will probably be expanded and updated as I go and learn more things. I have barely scratched the surface on the mechanics, but I am always seeking to improve. Maybe builds, expanded play style overview, countering, and all that stuff. I haven't played a diverse range of gears, so I can't really just rip-off other builds and post them here. Probably the only thing I can share is how I lost on that build... which is a really good idea to share, if you think about it. But I guess this is it for now.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">May your infamy rise and loot tabs full, and as always, Happy Hunting.</p>
