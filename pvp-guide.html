                </div>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    Many new players in Albion Online are asking “What build is the best?”, “What weapon should I spec up?”. It is hard to answer that because there are many viable builds that is best in different contents of the game. So, to properly answer their question, you should ask them first on what content they like on the end game. There are different kinds of content in Albion in terms of PVP, PVE, and Economy. Let’s discuss that one by one.   
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    In terms of PVP, it can range from <strong>small scale</strong> to <strong>large scale</strong>.
                </p>   
                
            <br>

                    <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Small Scale PVP</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Skirmishes from 1v1 to the smallest "zerg"</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h4 class="my-3">Corrupted Dungeons (CDG)</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            If you want to fame farm and to have a 1v1 PVP experience. This is the dungeon for you. As this dungeon let’s you have a combined PVP and PVE experience. Inside the dungeon you can clear the monsters or use them as an extra weapon to fend off another player that tries to invade you. </p>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            There are three different levels of these types of dungeon. First is Hunter Level which is only accessible in Yellow and Blue Zones and requires you to have at least 900 IP to enter. This level is non-lethal meaning that even if you die, your items will not drop. Next level is Stalker Level you need to have 1000 IP to enter. Lastly is Slayer Level which needs 50,000 infamy before unlocking and 1200 IP for you to enter. Both Stalker and Slayer levels are lethal which means it is a full loot PVP. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Infamy is gained by killing mobs inside the dungeon or killing players. If you kill a player you’ll gain 8% of their current infamy, and if you were killed you will lose 10% of your current infamy. Infamy is like rankings/mmr/elo in other games. NOTE: Builds in CDg varies on the current meta of the game, so watch youtube clips and check the weekly top 10 infamy players’ build inside the game. Your main profit in this dungeon is the equipment that you will get when you kill a player.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            Just like CDg this dungeon combines PVP and PVE, but the only difference is that in HG you will play with your team. HG have 3 types. 2v2,5v5, and 10v10 (this is self-explanatory). If you need to practice your team composition and team chemistry, you can do non-lethal hellgates first, so you will not lose your items when you die. If you think your team is ready, you can go straight to lethal hellgates. Loots in this dungeon is very high but it is very risky. Again, builds vary depending on the meta. You can research on your own or ask any officers or veterans in the guild to guide you.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="my-3">Crystal League (CGvG)</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            The endgame and the most competitive Small Scale PVP. Crystal leagues have two types: 5v5 and 20v20. This is purely PVP and <strong>top guilds are willing to pay a lot of silver for crystal leagues player</strong>. Why? Because Crystal League can give a lot of season points every win and it is the only way to level up guild’s owned territories. Crystal Leagues have level 1 to 9. Where in high level crystal leagues (level 7 – 9) are being broadcasted on Albion’s official twitch channel. If you win a Level 9 CGvG, Congrats! You’re the season champion for crystal league and you’ll rewarded with a swiftclaw skin that worth billions. Hellgate builds and Crystal League builds are somehow similar.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            This is the main source of “small scale content”. Inside the roads of Avalon you can have a lot of enemies that is thirsty for some PVP action. You can dive chests area and steal their loots or just find a hot zone or portal that is used often. Ask any officer or veterans in the guild about the build.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            You can do this solo or with a group. This type of PVP is like being a total criminal inside the game. You kill players that are transporting, gathering, or just came out of there dungeons. But beware because some players wants to be gank so they can wipe the gankers in the zone. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            In mage raiding you kill the mages inside the enemy guilds’ territory to gain season points and siphon energy for your own guild. It can be considered as small scale PVP since enemy guilds often defends their mages since you are stealing season points from them. I also made a guide about mage raiding (Coming Soon!).

                            This is the main “guild war” of the game and it is the ultimate content of every top guilds of Albion. This a very large-scale fight that range from 100 vs 100 players in the Black Zone. The main objective of these fights is to capture Outposts, Castles, and Territories. All those generates season points. Season points are very important for guilds who wants to achieve ranks in a season because of the Battlemount season rewards and of course for bragging rights.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            The basic ZvZ roles are Tanks, Healers, Support, Ranged DPS (RDPS) and Melee DPS (MDPS).

                            Faction War is just like ZvZ but with no Season Points but you will gain faction points. You can gain Faction points by claiming outposts and killing players in the royal city while you are flagged for the city in which you are enlisted with. You can use faction points to trade it to hearts or faction mounts. These will get you a lot of profit in the long run.
